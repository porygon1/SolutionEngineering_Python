## Machine Learning Approach

### Recommendation Strategies

The system employs multiple complementary approaches to music recommendation:

#### 1. Clustering-Based Recommendations (HDBSCAN)
Groups songs with similar characteristics and recommends within clusters:

- **Naive Features**: Uses basic Spotify audio features (12 dimensions)
- **PCA Features**: Applies dimensionality reduction to basic features (6 components)
- **Combined Features**: Merges basic and derived audio characteristics
- **Low-Level Audio**: Utilizes detailed spectral and temporal features
- **LLAV PCA**: Applies PCA to low-level audio features (60 components)

#### 2. Lyrics-Based Recommendations
Analyzes lyrical content for thematic similarity:

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts lyrics to numerical representations
- **Multiple Similarity Metrics**: Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: SVD for efficient similarity computation
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Text cleaning, lemmatization, stop word removal

### Model Selection and Comparison

The system allows users to compare different recommendation approaches:

- **Performance Metrics**: Precision, recall, diversity, novelty
- **User Feedback Integration**: Like/unlike functionality for model improvement
- **A/B Testing Capability**: Compare model performance in real-time
- **Adaptive Recommendations**: Models learn from user interactions

## Data Flow and Processing

### 1. Data Ingestion
```
Raw Data → Validation → Feature Engineering → Storage
```

- **Source Data**: Spotify track database with audio features
- **Quality Checks**: Data validation and cleaning
- **Feature Creation**: Derived features and transformations
- **Storage**: Optimized database schema with proper indexing

### 2. Model Training
```
Training Data → Feature Preparation → Model Training → Validation → Deployment
```

- **Automated Pipeline**: Scheduled model retraining
- **Cross-Validation**: Robust model performance assessment
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized model configurations
- **Model Versioning**: Track model performance over time

### 3. Recommendation Generation
```
User Request → Model Selection → Feature Lookup → Prediction → Response
```

- **Real-Time Processing**: Sub-second recommendation generation
- **Caching Strategy**: Frequently requested recommendations cached
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple models ensure system reliability
- **Personalization**: User history influences recommendations
